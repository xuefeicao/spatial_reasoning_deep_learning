# Spatial Reasoning with deep learning
This projects focuses on the study of whether cutting-edge deep learning methods can beat human on the difficult task like spatial reasoning which is 
very important to many AI technique including autonamous cars. 

This is a project collaborated with Drew Linsley (http://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/person/drew-linsley/). 

## Getting Started
Before using the repo, download the vgg_pretrained weight 

## Introduction 
1. vgg16_svrt: try to verify the vgg16 alone cannot make perfect spatial inferece and figure out the task which vgg16 can solve

2. transformer_vgg16: use https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02025 

3. training_lenet_minist: the image patch is small, so try this to see whether results are improved (3 have been added in to 4)

4. attention_svrt: including DRAW_VGG and DRAW_Lenet

5. SAN: including SALICON and SANS(stacked attention networks)
combine two attention mechanism
